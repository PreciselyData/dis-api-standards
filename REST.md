# REST API Standard

Rest stands for "Representational State Transfer".

REST is a programmatic interface that allows applications web-based access to endpoints to provide access to services.  These services, backed by the HTTP protocol, are secure and scalable.

This document describes the best practices for implementing REST services at Precisely.

## HTTP Access Methods

HTTP verbs are used to access methods within a REST service.  These verbs, or HTTP request strings, describe the actions that an application wishes to perform against a service.  They are listed below, along with example use cases, and example response codes.  Response codes dictate the results of the actions, and are specific to the REST service logic.

| Request Verb | Possible Response Codes | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | 200 | |
| POST | | |
| PUT | |
| DELETE | |
| PATCH | |
